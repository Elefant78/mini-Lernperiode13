# mini-Lernperiode13
This just cover's a brief 4 week where I try to learn a new programming skill.


### Selection
For the decission of the skill which I will learn in the next 4 weeks. I am going to pick three things which intresset me and then evaluate which one to focus on.

One thing that immediately came into mind was C, the classic as it is a pretty old language but it stil stod the test of time. 
Secondly Rust, this is timewise the opposite of C and it is considered the new C.
Lastely, React.js this JS-Framework would be more of an building stone then a completely new Programming language. 

### Decision
I personally decided to g for C as it seemed like the grand father of Programming languages. I also want to deepen my knowledge in a more old-school language, as a lot of things are nowadays done for you. The realation between compiler and source code and so on

### Action
The first task seemed pretty easy to follow, creating the classic hello world. This seemed pretty easy as it is usally give by deafualt when you create a new projekt. But as is started C on VSC, nothing. Then I googled how I can print Hello, world. I took the input wrote it into my file and wanted to run it but there was no run button. I first had to compile the Source Code into a 0 and 1 which the Computers understands. To do that you use the Terminal, in which you can compile the Code written into a language that the Computers understands. And with this you can run the programm.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{

    printf("hello,World!\n");

}
