# mini-Lernperiode13
This just cover's a brief 4 week where I try to learn a new programming skill.


### Selection
For the decission of the skill which I will learn in the next 4 weeks. I am going to pick three things which intresset me and then evaluate which one to focus on.

One thing that immediately came into mind was C, the classic as it is a pretty old language but it stil stod the test of time. 
Secondly Rust, this is timewise the opposite of C and it is considered the new C.
Lastely, React.js this JS-Framework would be more of an building stone then a completely new Programming language. 

### Decision
I personally decided to g for C as it seemed like the grand father of Programming languages. I also want to deepen my knowledge in a more old-school language, as a lot of things are nowadays done for you. The realation between compiler and source code and so on

## Action

### Hello World
The first task seemed pretty easy to follow, creating the classic hello world. This seemed pretty easy as it is usally give by deafualt when you create a new projekt. But as is started C on VSC, nothing. Then I googled how I can print Hello, world. I took the input wrote it into my file and wanted to run it but there was no run button. I first had to compile the Source Code into a 0 and 1 which the Computers understands. To do that you use the Terminal, in which you can compile the Code written into a language that the Computers understands. And with this you can run the programm.

The Code 

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("hello,World!\n");
}

This is the Code for hello World. It looks pretty normal but there is a lot of syntax which could result in some anoyning mistakes. The realtion with the Terminal is intressting as it requers more logic.

Next I wated to take Input of the User like a Console.readline. 
So it goes back to googling and reading. It is interesting that for every little things u want to do you have to download them form a library and you feel really lost. Hence I used something more User friendly the https://manual.cs50.io/ it helps to reduce the amount of input. I used the library cs50.h

With this Code i can get the input of a user 

    string a = get_string("What is your name? ");

With this I can Output the variabel 

    printf("hello, %s\n", a);

The %s is the most bizarre part until now
